# About Me

I'm currently a sophomore at Duke University double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Literature. I'm passionate about the mathematical foundations of data analysis as well as the robust applications of data science. At Duke, I'm also an RA, a peer tutor, involved in [student government](https://www.dukestudentgovernment.org/meet-us) , and a member of the [debate team](http://www.dukedebate.org/).
